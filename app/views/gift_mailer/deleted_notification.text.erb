A gift you're buying has been deleted
=====================================

Hi, <%= @user.full_name %>
We are really sorry, but it looks as if the <%= @gift.name %> gift you were buying for <%= @list_user.full_name %> has been deleted.

Obviously there are a few reasons why this might have happened. Maybe they treated themselves and bought it or maybe they just don't really want it anymore. I would suggest maybe heading back to their list and choosing another gift.

Why not hop, skip or jump back to their list (http://pinefor.it/public/<%= @gift.list.public_hash %>) to pick another gift.

Thanks
The Pinefor team
