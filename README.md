# maison.io

This is my website and will also server as a blog and personal api. With this new site Im going to try and keep with the whole Homestead movement as talked about by Frank Chimero [here.](http://frankchimero.com/blog/2013/12/homesteading-2014/)

I will use this Readme to link off to other more in-depth pages:
